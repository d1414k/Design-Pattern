Solid Design Principles \
    1. SRP : single responsibility principle : https://github.com/d1414k/Design-Pattern/blob/main/src.com.activemesa.solid.srp.SRP.java.txt \
        A class will have only one responsibility.\
    2. OCP : Open closed principle : https://github.com/d1414k/Design-Pattern/blob/main/src.com.activemesa.solid.ocp.OCP.java.txt \
        open for extention and closed for modification. \
    3. LSP : Lisko substitution principle : \
        While inherting some class all functions will have to behave correctly. \
        Ex: Rectangle , Square area calculation
    4. ISP : Interface seggrigation principle \
        Interface should conatains as min funtion as possible otherwise even though a class do no need some \
        funtion but it need to implement it.
    5. DIP : Dependency inversion principle \
        High level module sould not depend on low level module
        use abstraction
