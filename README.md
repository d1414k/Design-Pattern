Solid Design Principles \
    1. SRP : single responsibility principle : https://github.com/d1414k/Design-Pattern/blob/main/src.com.activemesa.solid.srp.SRP.java.txt \
        A class will have only one responsibility.\
    2. OCP : Open closed principle : https://github.com/d1414k/Design-Pattern/blob/main/src.com.activemesa.solid.ocp.OCP.java.txt \
        open for extention and closed for modification. \
    3. LSP : Lisko substitution principle : https://github.com/d1414k/Design-Pattern/blob/main/src.com.activemesa.solid.lsp.LSP.java.txt \
        While inherting some class all functions will have to behave correctly. \
        Ex: Rectangle , Square area calculation \
    4. ISP : Interface seggrigation principle  https://github.com/d1414k/Design-Pattern/blob/main/src.com.activemesa.solid.isp.ISP.java.txt \
        Interface should conatains as min funtion as possible otherwise even though a class do no need some \
        funtion but it need to implement it. \
    5. DIP : Dependency inversion principle https://github.com/d1414k/Design-Pattern/blob/main/src.com.activemesa.solid.dip.DIP.java.txt \
        A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. \ 
        Both should depend on abstractions. \
        B. Abstractions should not depend on details. \
        Details should depend on abstractions. \
        
     
     GAMMA Categorization of Design pattern
     1. Creational pattern
        Deal with creating objects
     2. Structural pattern
        Deals with code structure
        API design
     3. Behavioural pattern
        No central theme
